# TicTacToe

This project is a simple tic tac toe game where the player must defeat roboto. This project was created using the Angular framework in version 10. The big challenge of this project was to create it without the help of frameworks like Bootstrap to help mainly in the page structure, responsiveness, modals and ect.Currently the game can only be played against roboto, I plan to add two player modes both online and offline in the future.

## Usage

The game does not need to be installed and can be accessed directly from the address: (https://roboto-tic-tac-toe.web.app/).
